Overview: 
The Airport Management System is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage airport operations.
Key feature:
Employee Management: The system maintains data on all employees including their name, salary, sex, shift, address, and role.
Airplane Management: The system keeps track of airplane details and the corresponding ownerâ€™s detail
Database Design:
Classes: The database includes classes for employees, airplanes, and owners.
Attributes: Each class has specific attributes. For example, the employee class has attributes for name, address, salary, etc., while the airplane class has attributes for the manufacturer, registration number, etc.
Relationships: The database also tracks relationships between classes. For example, it keeps track of which employees work on which type of plane and which owners own which airplanes.
